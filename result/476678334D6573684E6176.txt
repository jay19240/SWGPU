* Class: Gfx3MeshNav

The `Gfx3MeshNav` class is responsible for controlling the navigation and collisions in a static mesh.
In collision case, the collision response sliding along the polygon of the map to keep a good
feeling for the player.
** Methods
- ''getLift''(): number~
The "getLift" function returns the value of the "lift" property.~
~
- ''loadFromJSM''(mesh: Gfx3Mesh): void~
The "loadFromJSM" function creates a binary tree partition based on the vertices of a given mesh.~
-- ''mesh''~
~
- ''move''(center: vec3, size: vec3, move: vec3): NavInfo~
The "move" function calculates the movement of an object in a 3D space, taking into account
collisions with walls and floors.~
-- ''center'': The `center` parameter is a 3D vector representing the center point of the
object or entity that is being moved.~
-- ''size'': The `size` parameter represents the dimensions of the object's bounding box. It
is a `vec3` vector that contains the width, height, and depth of the object.~
-- ''move'': The `move` parameter is a 3D vector that represents the desired movement of an
object. It specifies how much the object should move along the x, y, and z axes.~
~
- ''setLift''(lift: number): void~
The "setLift" function sets the value of the "lift" property.~
-- ''lift'': The lift is used to elevate the virtual bounding box to let
passing over little step or micro obstacles on the floor.~
** Constructors
- ''new Gfx3MeshNav''(): Gfx3MeshNav~
The constructor.~
