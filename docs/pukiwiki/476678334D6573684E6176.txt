* Class: Gfx3MeshNav

Controlling navigation and collisions responses in a static mesh.~
In collision case, the collision response sliding along the polygon of the map to keep a good~
feeling for the player.~
** Constructors
- ''new Gfx3MeshNav''(): Gfx3MeshNav~
** Methods
- ''getLift''(): number~
Returns the lift.~
~
- ''loadFromJSM''(mesh: Gfx3Mesh): void~
Load a static mesh as a nav-mesh.~
-- ''mesh'': The static mesh.~
~
- ''move''(center: vec3, size: vec3, move: vec3): NavInfo~
Move the virtual box and returns response collision move, a boolean to check wall collide and a boolean to check floor collide.~
-- ''center'': The center point of the box.~
-- ''size'': The size of the box.~
-- ''move'': The movement.~
~
- ''setLift''(lift: number): void~
Set the lift.~
-- ''lift'': The lift is used to elevate the virtual bounding box to let passing over little step or micro obstacles on the floor.~
