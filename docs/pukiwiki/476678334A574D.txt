* Class: Gfx3JWM

A 3D walkmesh.~
In collision case, the collision response sliding along the edges of the walkmesh to keep a good feeling for the player.~
- inherit from: Gfx3Transformable~
** Constructors
- ''new Gfx3JWM''(): Gfx3JWM~
** Methods
- ''addWalker''(id: string, x: number, z: number, radius: number): Walker~
Add a new walker.~
Note: A walker is the representation of a moving entity inside a walkmesh context. It is a square moving along the floor.~
-- ''id'': A unique identifier.~
-- ''x'': The x-coordinate of the walker's starting position.~
-- ''z'': The z-coordinate of the walker's starting position.~
-- ''radius'': The size.~
~
- ''clearWalkers''(): void~
Delete all walkers.~
~
- ''draw''(): void~
The draw function.~
~
- ''loadFromFile''(path: string): Promise~
Load asynchronously walkmesh data from a json file (jwm).~
-- ''path'': The file path.~
~
- ''moveWalker''(id: string, mx: number, mz: number): vec3~
Move a walker.~
-- ''id'': The unique identifier of the walker.~
-- ''mx'': The movement in the x-axis.~
-- ''mz'': The movement in the z-axis.~
~
- ''update''(): void~
The update function.~
