**WarmeY2K** is a fully packed **2D/3D game engine** dedicated to **Y2K games** on the web !     
The first part of the name (W.A.R.M.E) is an acronym for **Web Against Regular Major Engines**, you can understand it like a tentative
to make a complete game engine for the web. The second part (Y.2.K) is the common acronym used to define the era covers **1998-2004** and define the technics limitation intentionally taken. These limitations are guarants of a human scaled tool and help a lot of to reduce the learning curve.

Some words about our philosophy:
- **Robustness:** We used only simple and efficient methods coming from the industrie for nearly two decades.     
- **Flexibility:** Create your own renderers. Handle render and update loops in a state-less way.    
- **Modularity:** We used modular architecture to keep things simple and separate.     
- **Performance:** We used WebGPU API for a blazing fast rendering.
- **Lightweight:** The lib minzipped size is just 73 kB (1Mb with Rapier2D & Rapier3D).

## Getting started - The engine way
A good start if you want make experimentation with samples and tutorials.
```
# git clone https://github.com/jay19240/WarmeY2K.git
# cd WarmeY2K
# npm install
# npm run dev
```

## Getting started - The boilerplate way
The perfect solution for serious project.     
It's included a complete environment including vite, typescript and the engine as dependency.
```
# git clone https://github.com/jay19240/WarmeY2K-Boilerplate.git
# cd WarmeY2K-Boilerplate
# npm install
# npm run dev
```

## Table of file formats
We've done a [Blender Exporter](https://github.com/jay19240/WarmeY2K/tree/main/bin#:~:text=WARME%2DBlender%2DExporter.zip) which is used to export your models as JSON-like or Binary format.

| Type            | JSON | Binary |
| --------------- | ---- | ------ |
| Animated mesh   | JAM  | BAM    |
| Static mesh     | JSM  | BSM    |
| Lines           | JLM  | BLM    |
| Point light     | JPL  |        |
| Trigger         | JTR  |        |
| Shadow volume   | JSV  | BSV    |
| Walkmesh        | JWM  | BWM    |

## Table of mesh ids
If you want enable *Color limit*, *Dithering* and *Shadow vol* you can sum all these values and set `2 + 4 + 16 = 22` to the channel `a`.
| Usage        | r  | g  | b  | a  |
| ------------ | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Identifier   | n  |    |    |    |
| Decals group |    | n  |    |    |
| Light group  |    |    | n  |    |
| Pixelation   |    |    |    | 1  |
| Color limit  |    |    |    | 2  |
| Dithering    |    |    |    | 4  |
| Outline      |    |    |    | 8  |
| Shadow vol   |    |    |    | 16 |

## Shader extension
Set your shader extension in your .env with the following variables :
| Name          | Description                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| MESH_VERT_EXT | Append a string to the mesh vertex shader   |

You can check variables you can work with just below.      
If you need add some extra variables, take a look at material custom params.
